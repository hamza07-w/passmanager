# __ðŸ¦…passwdmanager__

### This is the first try of my handling with sql databases using SQLite3 library in python, This is a simple program organazie, generate, add, update, delete, show and save the password at a database, at this moment its not safe 100%, it could be dangerous because of the inputs are not secure against SQL injection and auther simillar injection attacks, but I'll update the program as I can and I'll add module that allow just u to accses into the progr by using unic generated admin password when you have to run the program.
